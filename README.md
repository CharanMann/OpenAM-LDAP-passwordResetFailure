2. Deploy the custom auth module. Refer instructions: *[Building and Installing Custom Authentication Modules](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openam/13.5/dev-guide#build-config-sample-auth-module)*
```
Register service and module: Note that for OpenAM v12 use amAuthHOTPExt-12.xml
$ ./ssoadm create-svc --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt --xmlfile ~/softwares/amAuthHOTPExt.xml
$ ./ssoadm register-auth-module --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt --authmodule com.sun.identity.authentication.modules.hotp.HOTPExt

UnRegister service and module (in case module needs to be uninstalled) : 
$ ./ssoadm unregister-auth-module --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt --authmodule com.sun.identity.authentication.modules.hotp.HOTPExt
$ ./ssoadm delete-svc --adminid amadmin --password-file /tmp/pwd.txt -s sunAMAuthHOTPExtService
```
3. Configure the custom auth module. Refer instructions: *[Configuring and Testing Custom Authentication Modules](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openam/13.5/dev-guide#configuring-testing-sample-auth-module)*
